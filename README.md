# ExampleFuncGen

This is an example of a project (including all the metadata necessary)
in order to create a user-readable list of programmatically generated
functions instead of wrapping them all as Python code.

NOTE: I don't particularly endorse this route. Just write code. But some
people like it. :)

## Usage

First install

```
pip install .
```

Then import as so:

```python
from examplefuncgen.features import foo_feature
from examplefuncgen.imputers import foo_imputer
```
